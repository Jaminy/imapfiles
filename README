Imapfiles was developed as free software to download the attachments contained in emails on an imap server and optionally
archive those messages to another imap folder once processed.

The python code can be used from the command line or as a module for use in other python scripts.

Usage: imapfiles [OPTIONS]

Options:

-c, --config
    path to a ini style config file. e.g.
    
    [general]
    destination=./files
    [imap]
    server=localhost
    username=username
    password=password
    folder=INBOX
    archive=archive

-s, --server
    imap server name or ip address

-u, --username
    imap users name

-p, --password
    imap users password

-f, --folder
    imap folder to download attachemnts from

-d, --destination
    local directory to store downloaded attachments.
    attachments are stored in date folders (bnsed on the emails sent date) with sub folders for each message.

-a, --archive
    you can optionally specify an imap folder to archive processed emails to avoid having to process all messages
    time the command is run

Examples:

python ./imapfiles -c imapfiles.cfg
python ./imapfiles -s localhost -u username -p password -f INBOX -d localdirectory
